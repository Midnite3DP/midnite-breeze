## This is my first time working in Fusion 360 and my first mechanical keyboard project.

### Support:
❌ Gust macropad
❌ Choc profile
✅ MX profile
✅ Ocean Breeze layout
✅ Southern Breeze layout
✅ Summer Breeze layout
✅ Tenting

### Included:
The files include STLs for the Top, Plate, and Bottom piece, each with a 'Small' and 'Large' variant. I didn't name them left/right because these files can be mirrored if you have an alternate Breeze layout. The USB-C and TRRS ports are large enough to support both positions.

There are tenting mounts and tenting legs with and without caps. The capless version of the legs can be useful if you want to add your own rubber plugs for extra grip. **Tenting does require some hardware:**
* M3x16mm Bolt/Thumb screws
* M3 Nuts

Optional hardware is:
* O-rings - as an interface between the tenting leg and the insert, for extra grip [CA Amazon](https://www.amazon.ca/ThreeBulls-120Pcs-Dampeners-Keyboards-Dampers/dp/B01N6438BK)[US Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/ThreeBulls-120Pcs-Dampeners-Keyboards-Dampers/dp/B01N6438BK)
* Rubber plugs - if you want more grip on the bottom of the tenting legs (use capless tenting legs) [CA Amazon](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07TXYSYS3)/[US Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Aislor-Bumpers-Rubber-Grippers-Spacers/dp/B08LQ192XK)
* M2x4mm Heatset inserts - if you want mounting points for the PCB

### 3D Printing:
I have done 50+ prints during my build process to ensure these files can be printed but it will require a well-tuned printer. I have an Ender 3 V2 with a metal extruder arm, an upgraded bowden tube, and a BLTouch. These pieces are designed to friction-fit together, so the Plate edges will be touching the inside walls of the Bottom piece, and the Top piece's inside walls will be touching the inside walls of the Bottom piece. 

### Note:
* There are mounting holes in the Bottom piece for installed heatset inserts so you can mount the PCB to the bottom of the case but I found these are not necessary. My tolerances are such that once the whole thing is put together, the assembly will not fall apart.
* There are some extra things I'd like to do for this project but it's taken me about a month to get to this point and I've had many issues along the way. That is to say, there's no guarantee that any more work is going to get done but please feel free to share your feedback here or contact me on Discord: [Breeze Discord](https://discord.gg/HU3YHDQG)
