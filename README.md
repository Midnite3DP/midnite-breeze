This is a 3-part 3D printed case that allows you to fully enclose your PCB. A well calibrated printer is recommended due to the tolerances required for friction-fit parts.

### Supported:
✅ MX profile  
✅ Ocean Breeze layout  
✅ Southern Breeze layout  
✅ Summer Breeze layout  
✅ Tenting  
✅ Breeze aluminum plate  

### Not Supported:
❌ Gust macropad
❌ Choc profile
❌ ErgoDox Tilt/Tent Kit

### Included:
The files include STLs for the Top, Plate, and Bottom piece - every piece can be mirrored in your slicer. The USB-C and TRRS ports are large enough to support both positions. Tenting is also included but is optional.


### Tenting: 
There are holes on the underside of the base so you can glue in ø 8mm magnets (3mm thick). You can then print your own tenting solution or use mine. I like the option of quickly removing my tenting, so I went with magnets.

### Mounting:
There are 4 (5 on the large base) to install M3 heatset inserts on the inside of the base so that you can screw-mount your PCB. In my test, I've found this to be unnecessary, but the option is there - if you're using the FR4 Plate, I recommend this screwing it in.

### 3D Printing:
No supports necessary - the only overhangs are on the ports (TRRS & USB) and the underside magnet holes. With enough cooling, I find this isn't an issue - I tested both PLA and ABS

Orientation:
* Print the Top piece upside down (flat side down on the build plate)
* Print the Plate flat, with the 'down' side touching the build plate
* Print the Bottom piece flat side down - no supports are needed
